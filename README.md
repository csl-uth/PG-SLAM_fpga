# pg-slam_fpga

This repository contains our MPSoC FPGA configurations for PG-SLAM (Pose Graph - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm. PG-SLAM introduces a pose graph optimization module, as an extension on the KinectFusion pipeline, to help recover the humanoid robot's pose. The original CUDA version on ROS of the algorithm is on [this repo](https://github.com/mrsp/slam_stack). Our work implements and evaluates a plethora of MPSoC FPGA designs, exploring a variety of precise and approximate optimizations.

Repository branches:

* sw-only: unoptimized baseline implementation running on ARM with OpenMP
* fastest_precise: fastest and precise HW implementation which implements the Bilateral Filter, Integration and Fuse Voxelgrids kernels on HW and enables all the precise optimization of them
* C1: approximate HW implementation which achieves the best performance (36.04 fps)
* C2: approximate HW implementation which achieves the best performance with zero untracked frames (28.23 fps)
* datasets: includes three trajectories generated in the lab environment using NAO humanoid robot with an Intel Realsense D455 RGB-D camera

## Usage
Vitis™ Unified Software Platform was used to run our experiments on Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102 Evaluation Kit. If you wish to build and run on an Alveo™ card you must make the necessary changes. 

### Requirements for the build environment
1. [Vitis™ Unified Software Platform 2019.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis/2019-2.html)
2. [Vitis™ Embedded Platform with DFX 2019.2 or 2020.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms/2019-2.html)
3. PetaLinux 2019.2 Sysroot directory for aarch32/aarch64 architectures - [Link](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools/2019-2.html)
4. Xilinx Runtime (for software emulation on x86 or Alveo™ cards) - [https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT](https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT)

Please consult Xilinx documentation for more detailed information.

### Requirements for the embedded platform
An embedded platform that runs PetaLinux with enabled XRT and OpenCL support. Check this [repository](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Embedded_Platform_Source) for more information.

### Build
There is a Makefile included that automates the build process for the ZCU102 board. It is based on makefiles provided in [Xilinx Vitis Acceleration Examples](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/2019.2). You can make changes to the Makefile according to your setup.

Commands to build for ZCU102:
1. `make bin DEVICE=zcu102_base_dfx`
2. `make host -j4 NATIVE=yes SYSROOT=<path/to/sysroots/aarch64-xilinx-linux>`

The results are created inside `xclbin` directory. Software binary is named `host` and the hardware binary `<name>.hw.xclbin`.

### Run
For our experiments we use the living-room trajectory 2 [ICL-NUIM dataset](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html). We create the `.raw` format using the `scene2raw.cpp` program of the slambench1 repo. Depending on the input trajectory you must provide the necessary arguments. For instance, to run trajectory 2 (using the default parameters) you must type the command:

`./host -i rb_trj0.raw -s 8 -p 4.0,4.0,4.0 -r 1 -c 2 -k 570.342,570.342,319.5,239.5 -a 50 -e 5 -o output.log -x hwKernels.hw.xclbin`
